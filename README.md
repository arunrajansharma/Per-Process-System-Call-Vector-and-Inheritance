# Per-Process-System-Call-Vector-and-Inheritance
Linux prohibits a loadable module from changing the global system call vector/table. Linux makes it hard to change system calls, either globally or on a per process (or process group) basis. Having different syscalls per process is useful for various scenarios. For example, to add tracing/printf messages for certain syscalls; to override the default behavior of a system call (e.g., to encrypt/decrypt file names); to prevent certain processes from invoking syscalls they shouldn't (e.g., a Web server typically has no business invoking mkdir(2), unless it was hijacked). We developed a system where each process can use a custom system call vectors. We also provided functionality for a child process to inherit the system call vector of its parent.
